The Zomato Sales Analysis project is centered on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset from Zomato, a global food delivery and restaurant discovery platform. Here's a detailed explanation of what the project involves:
Project Workflow
Data Collection and Import:

The project starts with importing a dataset related to Zomato's operations. This dataset could include information such as customer orders, restaurant details, customer reviews, and more.
The dataset is loaded into a Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries like pandas.
Data Cleaning:

Before analyzing the data, the project involves cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, correcting data types, and possibly removing outliers.
This step ensures that the data is ready for analysis and that the results are accurate and reliable.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The core of the project is the EDA, where various techniques are applied to explore the dataset.
Visualization: Libraries like matplotlib and seaborn are used to create visual representations of the data. These visuals help in understanding trends, distributions, and relationships within the data.
Analysis: Different aspects of the data are analyzed, such as:
Customer Behavior: Analyzing what types of food are most ordered, peak ordering times, and customer preferences.
Restaurant Performance: Identifying top-rated restaurants, analyzing the impact of customer reviews on restaurant popularity, and looking into the most popular cuisines.
Sales Trends: Exploring how sales have changed over time, which locations are generating the most revenue, and other sales-related metrics.

Insights and Results:

After performing the EDA, the project summarizes the key findings. These could include:
Trends in customer ordering behavior (e.g., favorite times to order, popular cuisines).
Identification of high-performing restaurants and factors contributing to their success.
Insights into how customer reviews impact restaurant ratings and sales.
Observations about market trends that could be valuable for Zomato's strategic planning.
Project Outcome
The outcome of this project is a comprehensive analysis of Zomato's dataset, providing actionable insights that can inform decision-making for the company. These insights might help in improving customer satisfaction, optimizing restaurant partnerships, and enhancing overall business strategies.
